[Henry](https://twitter.com/henrygarner) gave a talk at London's [Clojure eXchange 2016](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7430-clojure-exchange-2016#program) on the subject of machine learning in Clojure.

From the programme:

<blockquote><p>
You have heard that Clojure’s ancestor language, Lisp, was developed for artificial intelligence research. Yet, until recently, Clojure’s support for machine learning has mostly consisted of wrapped Java libraries.</p>

<p>Informed by his work as a freelance data scientist working primarily with Clojure, Henry will explore some newer libraries that enable sophisticated data analysis unencumbered by Java’s legacy. You will also learn how Clojure’s core sequence-processing strengths naturally lend themselves to simple machine learning techniques you can try at home.

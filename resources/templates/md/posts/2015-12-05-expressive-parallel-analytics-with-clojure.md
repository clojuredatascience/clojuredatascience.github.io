[Henry](https://twitter.com/henrygarner) spoke at [Clojure eXchange 2015](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6861-clojure-exchange-2015#program) on the subject of parallel folds using Clojure's transducers.

From the programme:

<blockquote><p>
Sharing experience gained from his work on a mission-critical data product earlier this year, Henry will speak about some newer features of Clojure that enable data scientists to write concise, expressive and performant data processing code. Heâ€™ll explore transducers and reducing functions, and show how simple functional combinators can make even sophisticated analytical code both faster and easier to comprehend.
</p></blockquote>

The key takeaway is that with transducers, reducing functions must now provide an arity-1 **completer** implementation which provides them with the opportunity to convert an accumulated value into a final output. Together with the (optional) arity-0 **initializer** this provides reducing functions the ability to wrap arbitrarily intricate state. The natural composability of transducers can be mirrored with similarly composable reducing functions to build up sophisticated parallel computations.

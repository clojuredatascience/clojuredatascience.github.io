 [Henry](https://twitter.com/henrygarner) wrote an article for InfoQ as part of their [Getting a Handle on Data Science](https://www.infoq.com/handle-data-science) series.

The article was titled [Data Science Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction](https://www.infoq.com/articles/data-science-abstraction) and in it he set out his reasons for adopting Clojure, including its:

* Excellent tooling for REPL-driven development and notebooks for exploratory analysis and live charting.
* Suitability for creating shareable browser-based visualisations and interactive simulations with modern UI frameworks like Facebook's React.
* Interoperability with Java, JavaScript, and Scala for making use of established and actively developed numerical optimisation, distributed computing, and machine learning libraries.
* Data-oriented functional core with a focus on composable sequence processing interfaces which scale with the volume of data you have.
* Clean and unambiguous syntax which even aids my comprehension of transcribed algorithms.
* Macro system which enables extensibility at the language level for custom algorithmic abstractions and cleaner code.

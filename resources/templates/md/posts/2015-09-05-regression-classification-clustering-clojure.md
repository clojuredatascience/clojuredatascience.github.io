Below are slides from a talk given to the [Bristol Clojurians](https://bristolclojurians.github.io/) on April 21st 2015.

I gave an overview of several key techniques presented in [Clojure for Data Science](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1784397180/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1784397180&linkCode=as2&tag=henrygarnerco-21), including linear &amp; logistic regression, <em>k</em>-means clustering. I gave a brief demonstration of visualization with [Quil](http://quil.info/) and of writing a Hadoop job with [Parkour](https://github.com/damballa/parkour) to make use of the [Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/) machine learning library.

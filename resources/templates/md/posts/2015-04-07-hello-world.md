Welcome to the companion website for the book **Clojure for Data Science**. The book is currently being written by [Henry Garner](http://henrygarner.com) and will be published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/) in the second half of 2015.

All code examples will be made available on the book's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/clojuredatascience/) for download. As publication approaches this site (and the related [wiki](https://github.com/clojuredatascience/clojuredatascience.github.io/wiki)) will be updated with excerpts and further information related to data science in general and Clojure in particular.

See you soon.
